Today we started working on the SRS for the project. We referenced the example documents from previous projects on teams as a guide for the format and sections. After spending a few hours, most of the sections like purpose, contributions,functional requirements, non-functional requirements, data were ready. We will be meeting again latet this week to finish the rest of the sections.

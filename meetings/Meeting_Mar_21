Today we spent the entire day working on the video.
We first created a script to use for the voiceover. Then we spent some time screen recording the app and user flow in our devices. After that we recorded the voiceover and edited the video. We added a couple of shots explaining the problem and the showing the flowchart diagrams for our backend services. After finalizing the video, we exported the project and submitted it on Avenue.
